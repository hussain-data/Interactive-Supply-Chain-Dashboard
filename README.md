# Interactive Supply Chain Dashboard

![Dashboard Preview](iscanal.jpg)

## üìñ Project Overview

This project features an interactive **Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) within a supply chain. The goal is to provide actionable insights into inventory management, logistics, supplier performance, and order fulfillment. By tracking these metrics, businesses can identify bottlenecks, reduce costs, and improve overall operational efficiency.

## üìä Key Metrics & KPIs Analyzed

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the supply chain operations, focusing on the following areas:

* **Inventory Management:**
    * **Units Sold** and **Inventory Levels** by product category and warehouse.
    * **Average Inventory** levels to identify carrying costs and stockout risks.
    * **Backorder Rates** to measure product availability and customer satisfaction.

* **Logistics & Transportation:**
    * **Transportation Costs** analyzed by region, warehouse, and product category.
    * **Lead Time** from order to delivery, highlighting delays and top-performing suppliers.

* **Order Fulfillment:**
    * **Order Status** tracking (Fulfilled, Pending, Canceled) to monitor fulfillment efficiency.
    * **Order Accuracy** rates to measure the percentage of orders filled correctly.

* **Financial Performance:**
    * **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** to understand the direct costs attributable to the production of goods sold.

## üì¶ Dataset

The analysis is based on the `Inventory_SupplyChain_Dataset.csv` file. This dataset contains transactional data including:
* Order dates
* Geographical regions
* Product and supplier details
* Warehouse information
* Key performance metrics like costs, inventory levels, and lead times.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

* **Power BI Desktop:** Used for data modeling, creating DAX calculations, and designing the interactive dashboard.
* **CSV:** The format of the source dataset.

1.  **Clone the Repository or Download Files:**
    * Download the following files:
        * `Inventory and supply chain Analysis.pbit`
        * `Inventory_SupplyChain_Dataset.csv`

2.  **Open the Power BI Template:**
    * You must have **Power BI Desktop** installed.
    * Double-click the `Inventory and supply chain Analysis.pbit` file to open it.

3.  **Load the Data:**
    * Upon opening the template file, Power BI will prompt you for the location of the dataset.
    * Navigate to where you saved `Inventory_SupplyChain_Dataset.csv` and select it.

4.  **Explore!**
    * Power BI will load the data into the model and the dashboard visuals will populate. You can now interact with the slicers, filters, and charts.
